                            In early 1916, life in the trenches was considered more comfortable by many Australian troops. For those who had served on Gallipoli, the conditions on the Western Front seemed very different. Billets were within 2 kilometres of the front. There were army canteens selling groceries, tobacco and clothing, and the men could buy champagne and beer from the closest estaminet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This would all change with the arrival of winter, the most severe experienced in northern France in 36 years. Thoroughly churned up by the bombardment of the first battle of the Somme, the ground became so waterlogged it turned into a quagmire that was almost impassable. The rains that fell throughout October and November were followed by almost continuous frost and snow, which aggravated the unpleasant living conditions nearer the front.

                                    Convicts were housed below deck on the prison deck and were confined behind bars. They had to sleep on hammocks and were rarely allowed time up on the deck to exercise and have fresh air. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A surgeon superintendent was employed to care for the prisoners’ health and a Religious Instructor attended their education. Warders maintained order.

                                <p>
                                    Convicts were forced to follow a strict set of rules. Cursing, shouting, fighting, selling, exchanging or giving away clothes were strictly forbidden. Prisoners were not allowed to converse with guards or members of the ship’s crew on any occasion and thievery of any of the ships stores would be punished severely.

                        In 1820, the convicts living at the Hyde Park Barracks would have been woken at sunrise by the ringing of a bell in the yard. They got out of their hammocks, went downstairs and were given breakfast – a salty meat stew sometimes with a few vegetables like cabbage, onion, potato and turnip.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The stew was cooked in a large pot that could hold 280 litres, and each man was served the same amount of meat, 227 grams (half a pound). They were also given bread. The men sat together in groups of six (known as ‘messes’), and one man had the job of giving out the food and making sure every man got the same amount.

                                    The stew was cooked in a large pot that could hold 280 litres, and each man was served the same amount of meat, 227 grams (half a pound). They were also given bread. The men sat together in groups of six (known as ‘messes’), and one man had the job of giving out the food and making sure every man got the same amount.

                                    The Deputy Superintendent would keep a close eye on the men preparing the food to make sure it was properly cooked and that each convict was given the correct amount. Later in the day, the men were given more food to eat.

                                    By 1826, convicts at the barracks were eating something different for breakfast – a plain-tasting porridge called ‘hominy’. It was made from corn and was boiled over a fire.
