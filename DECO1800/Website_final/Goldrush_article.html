                                Gold in Queensland

                                Gold symbolises wealth. It transformed Queensland’s history and landscape. Gold brought migrants from other colonies and overseas and it established new towns, some in areas not previously settled by Europeans. The timely discovery of gold at Gympie in 1867 saved Queensland from the worst effects of the 1866 economic depression, and provided an important boost during the first 50 years of the State.

                                Although gold mining was less important than coal for much of the twentieth century, when coal prices fell in the 1980s and gold prices climbed, gold mining was once again actively pursued and old goldfields such as Charters Towers and Cracow reopened.

                                        Small gold deposits were discovered across the Darling Downs through the 1850s, preceding the first gold rush in Queensland at Canoona near Rockhampton in
                                        1858. The Canoona rush was proved to be a relatively small deposit and was quickly stripped. Yet thousands continued arriving into Rockhampton only to
                                        have to leave again, often destitute. Exploration continued apace over the next
                                        few years after the discovery at Gympie, with discoveries of gold at Charters
                                        Towers in 1872 and a rush to the Palmer River in 1873, after the discovery of
                                        alluvial gold there by James Mulligan.

                            <p>
                                A typical digger was a man in his 20s, either unmarried
                                or with a young family. Although doctors and lawyers
                                came to the goldfields, most diggers were tradesmen
                                such as blacksmiths, builders, butchers, carpenters and
                                shoemakers. They were well educated and most could
                                read and write.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some people came to the diggings from nearby
                                cities and towns by coach or on foot. Others came
                                from all over Australia or from overseas. For those
                                seeking their fortune, no distance was too far and
                                no cost too great.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most of the diggers who came from overseas
                                were either:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>English</li>
                                    <li>Welsh</li>
                                    <li>Irish</li>
                                    <li>Scottish</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>

                                        A typical digger was a man in his 20s, either unmarried
                                        or with a young family. Although doctors and lawyers
                                        came to the goldfields, most diggers were tradesmen
                                        such as blacksmiths, builders, butchers, carpenters and
                                        shoemakers. They were well educated and most could
                                        read and write.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Some people came to the diggings from nearby
                                        cities and towns by coach or on foot. Others came
                                        from all over Australia or from overseas. For those
                                        seeking their fortune, no distance was too far and
                                        no cost too great.

                                    <p>
                                        Most of the diggers who came from overseas
                                        were either:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>English</li>
                                            <li>Welsh</li>
                                            <li>Irish</li>
                                            <li>Scottish</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Europeans were also keen to make
                                        their fortune and came from:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Germany</li>
                                            <li>Italy</li>
                                            <li>Poland</li>
                                            <li>Denmark</li>
                                            <li>France</li>
                                            <li>Spain</li>

                                        Californian diggers came from America, and when news of the
                                        riches being discovered spread to Asia, Chinese
                                        diggers came too.

                                When diggers arrived at a new goldfield they usually
                                needed to find somewhere to live. Most diggers
                                bought a roll of canvas and looked for an open piece
                                of ground. Chopping down any trees in the way, they
                                would build their first home, a tent. This provided
                                enough room for one or two beds, a place to eat, and
                                storage for their tools and personal belongings.

                                Diggers added a few luxuries if they decided to stay
                                for a while. A stone fireplace at one end of the tent
                                meant they no longer had to cook in the open.
                                The fire also provided warmth in winter. A wooden
                                floor kept their belongings out of the mud.

                                Despite these improvements, tent life was not
                                comfortable. Canvas walls and roofs did not keep
                                out the heat of the Australian summer or provide
                                protection from the biting winter cold. Although
                                tents gave shelter from the rain, they did not keep
                                out insects, snakes or other wildlife.

                                        Some diggers became tired of tent life and built
                                        themselves more substantial bark huts.
                                        The result was a simple but sturdy home. Some diggers
                                        made them even more comfortable by constructing
                                        wooden shutters for the windows, putting down a
                                        wooden floor and lining the bark walls with canvas.
                                        The lining kept out the wind, insects and snakes.
                                        In some areas, Aboriginal men made money building
                                        bark huts for the diggers. In Gympie, Queensland, they
                                        were paid about three shillings for this work.
