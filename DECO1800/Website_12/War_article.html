                            In early 1916, life in the trenches was considered more comfortable by many Australian troops. For those who had served on Gallipoli, the conditions on the Western Front seemed very different. Billets were within 2 kilometres of the front. There were
                            army canteens selling groceries, tobacco and clothing, and the men could buy champagne and beer from the closest estaminet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This would all change with the arrival of winter, the most severe experienced in northern France in 36 years. Thoroughly churned up by the bombardment of the first battle of the Somme, the ground became so waterlogged it turned into a quagmire that was
                            almost impassable. The rains that fell throughout October and November were followed by almost continuous frost and snow, which aggravated the unpleasant living conditions nearer the front.

                                        Convicts were housed below deck on the prison deck and were confined behind bars. They had to sleep on hammocks and were rarely allowed time up on the deck to exercise and have fresh air.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A surgeon superintendent was employed to care for the prisoners’ health and a Religious Instructor attended their education. Warders maintained order.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Convicts were forced to follow a strict set of rules. Cursing, shouting, fighting, selling, exchanging or giving away clothes were strictly forbidden. Prisoners were not allowed to converse with guards or members of the ship’s crew on any occasion and
                                        thievery of any of the ships stores would be punished severely.

                            There were over 200 rules that convicts had to follow, and the punishment for their breakage was often brutal and severe. Primary forms of punishment included:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Solitary confinement</li>
                                <li>Being forced to wear leg irons</li>
                                <li>The treadmill</li>
                                <li>Flogging</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>
                                Solitary Confinement
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                The barracks had ten solitary confinement cells, which were used for convicts who had returned to the Barracks late, drunk or for committing other minor crimes. These cells were small, cramped and dark (with no windows). At different times of year, these
                                cells could be either very hot or very cold.
                            </p>

                                            Convicts might have been left in these cells for up to three weeks. During this time they were only given bread and water.

                                            More serious crimes resulting in convicts being forced to wear leg irons. These were very heavy (weighing approximately 18 kilograms) and very uncomfortable. When walking the irons would rub against the convicts ankles, becoming very painful.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Sometimes convicts were forced to wear them for months.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            These irons were fixed around convicts ankles by a blacksmith. They had no key to take them off instead a blacksmith had to hammer out the rivet while the convict was still wearing them.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>

                                        <p>
                                            The treadmill was a machine powered by convicts walking continuously, to power a wheel. It was hard punishment and men walking on it had to power it all day. They walked 40 minutes at a time, resting only for twenty minute spurts in between.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            For even more serious crimes, a convict could be flogged with a cat-o’-nine tails. However, this punishment had to be approved by a magistrate of a court of the Governor. Convicts at the barracks were forced to watch all floggings.
                                        </p>

                                            Floggings could be the punishment for many different crimes. In 1883:

                                                <li>John Dennin was given 25 lashes for not doing his work</li>
                                                <li>John Carrli was given 36 lashes for pretending to be sick</li>
                                                <li>Alexander Somers was given 25 lashes for leaving the barracks without permission</li>
                                                <li>Daniel Dicken was given 50 lashes for disobeying orders </li>

                            In 1820, the convicts living at the Hyde Park Barracks would have been woken at sunrise by the ringing of a bell in the yard. They got out of their hammocks, went downstairs and were given breakfast – a salty meat stew sometimes with a few vegetables
                            like cabbage, onion, potato and turnip.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The stew was cooked in a large pot that could hold 280 litres, and each man was served the same amount of meat, 227 grams (half a pound). They were also given bread. The men sat together in groups of six (known as ‘messes’), and one man had the job of
                            giving out the food and making sure every man got the same amount.

                                        The Deputy Superintendent would keep a close eye on the men preparing the food to make sure it was properly cooked and that each convict was given the correct amount. Later in the day, the men were given more food to eat.

                                        By 1826, convicts at the barracks were eating something different for breakfast – a plain-tasting porridge called ‘hominy’. It was made from corn and was boiled over a fire.
