                <p>
                    (Charlotte) "A little tired, perhaps. But I feel peaceful.
                    Your success in the ring this morning was, to a small degree, any success.
                    Your future is assured.
                    You will live, secure and safe, Wilbur.
                    Nothing can harm you now. These autumn days will shorten and grow cold.
                    The leaves will shake loose from the trees and fall.
                    Christmas will come, then the snows of winter.
                    <phrase>You will live to enjoy the beauty of the frozen world</phrase>,
                    for you mean a great deal to Zuckerman and he will not harm you, ever.
                    Winter will pass, the days will lengthen, the ice will melt in the pasture pond.
                    The song sparrow will return and sing, the frogs will awake, the warm wind will blow again.
                    All these sights and sounds and smells will be yours to enjoy,
                    Wilbur - this lovely world, these precious days ..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wilbur remembered what Charlotte had told him
                    - that the sac was waterproof and strong.
                    It felt funny on his tongue and made him drool a bit.
                    And of course he couldn't say anything.
                    But as he was being shoved into the crate, he looked up at Charlotte and gave her a wink.
                    She knew he was saying good-bye in the only way he could.
                    And she knew her children were safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Good-bye!" she whispered.
                    Then she summoned all her strength and waved one of her front legs at him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She never moved again.
                    Next day, as the Ferris wheel was being taken apart and the race horses were
                    being loaded into vans and the entertainers were packing up their belongings
                    and driving away in their trailers, Charlotte died.
                    The Fair Grounds were soon deserted.
                    The sheds and buildings were empty and forlorn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The infield was littered with bottles and trash.
                    Nobody, of the hundreds of people that had visited the Fair,
                    knew that a grey spider had played the most important part of all.
                    No one was with her when she died.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Zuckerman took fine care of Wilbur all the rest of his days,
                    and the pig was often visited by friends and admirers,
                    for nobody ever forgot the year of his triumph and the miracle of the web.
                    Life in the barn was very good - night and day,
                    winter and summer, spring and fall, dull days and bright days.
                    It was the best place to be, thought Wilbur,
                    this warm delicious cellar, with the garrulous geese, the changing seasons,
                    the heat of the sun, the passage of swallows, the nearness of rats,
                    the sameness of sheep, the love of spiders, the smell of manure,
                    and the glory of everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <phrase>Wilbur never forgot Charlotte.</phrase>
                    Although he loved her children and grandchildren dearly,
                    none of the newspiders ever quite took her place in his heart.
                    She was in a class by herself.
                    It is not often that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good writer.
                    Charlotte was both.
