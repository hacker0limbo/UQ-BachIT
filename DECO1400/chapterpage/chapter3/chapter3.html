                <h2>The Last Web</h2>
                <p>
                    Charlotte went back to her work. It was quite dark now.
                    In the distance, fireworks began going off - rockets, scattering fiery balls in the sky.
                    By the time the Arables and the Zuckermans and Lurvy returned from the grandstand,
                    Charlotte had finished her web. The word
                </p>
                <word>
                    HUMBLE
                </word>
                <p class="from-start">
                    was woven neatly in the center.
                    Nobody noticed it in the darkness. Everyone was tired and happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next morning when the first light came into the sky and the sparrows stirred in the trees,
                    when the cows rattled their chains and the rooster crowed and the early automobiles went whispering along the road,
                    Wilbur awoke and looked for Charlotte.
                    He saw her up overhead in a corner near the back of his pen.
                    She was very quiet.
                    Her eight legs were spread wide.
                    She seemed to have shrunk during the night.
                    Next to her, attached to the ceiling, Wilbur saw a curious object.
                    It was a sort of sac, or cocoon.
                    It was peachcolored and looked as though it were made of cotton candy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Charlotte's web never looked more beautiful than it looked this morning.
                    Each strand held dozens of bright drops of early morning dew.
                    The light from the east struck it and made it all plain and clear.
                    It was a perfect piece of designing and building.
                    In another hour or two, a steady stream of people would pass by, admiring it, and reading it,
                    and looking at Wilbur, and marveling at the miracle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At nine o'clock, Mr. Arable's truck rolled into the Fair Grounds and came to a stop at Wilbur's pen.
                    Everybody climbed out.
                </p>
                <p class="from-start">
                    "Look!" cried Fern. "Look at Charlotte's web! Look what it says!"
                </p>
                <p class="from-start">
                    The grownups and the children joined hands and stood there,
                    studying the new sign.
                </p>
                <p class="from-start">
                    "'Humble,'" said Mr. Zuckerman.
                    "Now isn't that just the word for Wilbur!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone rejoiced to find that the miracle of the web had been repeated.
                    Wilbur gazed up lovingly into their faces.
                    He looked very humble and very grateful.
