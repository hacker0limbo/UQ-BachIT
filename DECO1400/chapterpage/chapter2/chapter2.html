                <h2>The Second Web</h2>
                <p>
                    Far into the night, while the other creatures slept, Charlotte worked on her web.
                    First she ripped out a few of the orb lines near the center.
                    She left the radial lines alone, as they were needed for support.
                    As she worked, her eight legs were a great help to her.
                    So were her teeth. She loved to weave and she was an expert at it.
                    When she was finished ripping things out, her web looked something like this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="./img/spider-web.png">
                </p>
                <p>
                    A spider can produce several kinds of thread.
                    She uses a dry, tough thread for foundation lines, and she uses a sticky thread for snare lines
                    - the ones that catch and hold insects.
                </p>
                <p class="from-start">
                    Charlotte decided to use her dry thread for writing the new message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If I write the word 'Terrific' with sticky thread," she thought,
                    "every bug that comes along will get stuck in it and spoil the effect."
                </p>
                <p class="from-start">
                    "Now let's see, the first letter is T."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Charlotte climbed to a point at the top of the left hand side of the web.
                    Swinging her spinnerets into position, she attached her thread and then droppeddown.
                    As she dropped, her spinning tubes went into action and she let out thread.
                    At the bottom, she attached the thread.
                    This formed the upright part of the letter T.
                    Charlotte was not satisfied, however.
                    She climbed up and made another attachment, right next to the first.
                    Then she carried the line down, so that she had a double line instead of a single line.
                    "It will show up better if I make the whole thing with double lines."
                </p>
                <p>
                    She climbed back up, moved over about an inch to the left, touched her spinnerets to the web, and then carried a line across to the right,
                    forming the top of the T.
                    She repeated this, making it double.
                    Her eight legs were very busy helping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Now for the E!" Charlotte got so interested in her work, she began to talk to herself, as though to cheer herself on.
                    If you had been sitting quietly in the barn cellar that evening, you would have heard something like this:
                </p>
                <p class="saying">
                    <i>
                        "Now for the R! Up we go! Attach! Descend! Pay out line! Whoa! Attach!
                        Good! Up you go! Repeat! Attach! Descend! Pay out line. Whoa, girl!
                        Steady now! Attach! Climb! Attach!
                        Over to the right! Pay out line! Attach!
                        Now right and down and swing that loop and around and around!
                        Now in to the left! Attach! Climb! Repeat! O.K.!
                        Easy, keep those lines together!
                        Now, then, out and down for the leg of the R!
                        Pay out line! Whoa! Attach! Ascend! Repeat! Good girl!"
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so, talking to herself, the spider worked at her difficult task.
                    When it was completed, she felt hungry.
                    She ate a small bug that she had been saving.
                    Then she slept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next morning, Wilbur arose and stood beneath the web.
                    He breathed the morning air into his lungs.
                    Drops of dew, catching the sun, made the web stand out clearly.
                    When Lurvy arrived with breakfast, there was the handsome pig,
                    and over him, woven neatly in block letters, was the word
