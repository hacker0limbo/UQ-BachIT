                <h2>The First Web</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that the broken egg was buried, the air cleared and the barn smelled good again.
                    The afternoon passed, and evening came.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shadows lengthened. The cool and kindly breath of evening entered through doors and windows.
                    Astride her web, Charlotte sat moodily eating a horsefly and thinking about the future.
                    After a while she bestirred herself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She descended to the center of the web and there she began to cut some of her lines.
                    She worked slowly but steadily while the other creatures drowsed.
                    None of the others, not even the goose, noticed that she was at work.
                    Deep in his soft bed, Wilbur snoozed.
                    Over in their favorite corner, the goslings whistled a night song.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Charlotte tore quite a section out of her web, leaving an open space in the middle.
                    Then she started weaving something to take the place of the threads she had removed.
                    When Templeton got back from the dump, around midnight, the spider was still at work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next day was foggy. Everything on the farm was dripping wet.
                    The grass looked like a magic carpet. The asparagus patch looked like a silver forest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On foggy mornings, Charlotte's web was truly a thing of beauty.
                    This morning each thin strand was decorated with dozens of tiny beads of water.
                    The web glistened in the light and made a pattern of loveliness and mystery, like a delicateveil.
                    Even Lurvy, who wasn't particularly interested in beauty, noticed the web when he came with the pig's breakfast.
                    He noted how clearly it showed up and he noted how big and carefully built it was.
                    And then he took another look and he saw something that made him set his pail down.
                    There, in the center of the web, neatly woven in block letters, was a message. It said:
                </p>
                <word class="words">
                    SOME PIG
                </word>
                <p class="from-start">
                    Lurvy felt weak. He brushed his hand across his eyes and stared harder at Charlotte's web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I'm seeing things," he whispered. He dropped to his knees and uttered a short prayer.
                    Then, forgetting all about Wilbur's breakfast, he walked back to the house and called Mr. Zuckerman.
